                <p>Rosetta Stone began with one man's dream to find a better way to learn a language. That dream has
                    since evolved into one of the most recognized technology-based learning companies in the world.</p>
                <p>After struggling to learn Russian through traditional methods, Founder Allen Stoltzfus set out to
                    develop an effective way to learn a new language through natural immersion in the late 1980s. He
                    envisioned using computer technology to simulate the way that people learn their native
                    language—with pictures and sounds in context, and with no translation—and innovate language
                    education for learners of all ages. Stoltzfus enlisted the help of his brother-in-law, John
                    Fairfield, to explore the possibilities of making his dream a reality and in 1992, CD-ROM technology
                    made the project possible. Together they founded Fairfield Language Technologies in Harrisonburg, VA
                    with Stoltzfus at the helm as the company's first Chairman and President. He recruited his brother,
                    Eugene Stoltzfus, to lend his design expertise to the structural and visual components of the
                    program. The resulting product was then named "Rosetta Stone," after the artifact that had unlocked
                    the secrets of Egyptian hieroglyphics for linguists. The name certainly fits, as Rosetta Stone
                    products now unlock learning success for millions of users worldwide.</p>
